# Operating-System-Lab
A collection of Operating Systems lab practicals implemented in C and Bash, covering process management, scheduling algorithms, deadlock avoidance, and shell scripting.
This repository contains all the practical programs and shell scripts implemented as part of the Operating Systems Laboratory for academic purposes. The programs cover core OS concepts such as process management, CPU scheduling, deadlock avoidance, and shell scripting.

1	Basic Ubuntu/Linux Commands and ls Options
2	Writing and Compiling C Programs in Terminal
3	Process Management Commands in Linux
4	Process Creation using fork() in C
5	FCFS CPU Scheduling Algorithm in C
6	SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling Algorithm in C
7	Priority Scheduling (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive) in C
8	Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance
9	Shell Scripts – File Ops, Loops, Custom Mini Shell
10	Shell Script using if-else & Result Classification Based on Marks
